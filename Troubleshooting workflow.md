# Troubleshooting Workflow

## Workflow Steps

1. **Initial Error Identification:**
   - Ran tests and identified failing tests and their error messages.

2. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):**
   - Performed RCA on the failing tests (treated as a primitive step).

3. **Hypothesis Formation:**
   - Formulated initial hypotheses based on the RCA results.

4. **Code Review:**
   - Instead of immediately implementing changes or running more tests, we first reviewed the actual implementation code.
   - This step helped us avoid making assumptions based solely on test behavior.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - Adjusted our hypotheses based on the code review findings.

6. **Mock Dependency Analysis:**
   - Examined the global dependencies of our mocks.
   - Analyzed how different mocks interact with each other.

7. **Documentation Update:**
   - Updated mock documentation with clearer explanations of dependencies, purposes, and usage.

8. **Test Constraint Documentation:**
   - Added comments to tests explaining the specific mock behaviors and constraints they rely on.

9. **Solution Proposal:**
   - Proposed changes to address the identified issues, based on our refined understanding.

10. **Verification Questions:**
    - Before implementing changes, we asked key questions like:
      - "Are we sure these are the reasons an illegal value was being passed?"
      - "Is it because we didn't fully consider the global dependencies of the mocks?"
    - These questions helped us avoid jumping to conclusions and encouraged deeper analysis.

11. **Implementation and Testing:**
    - Implemented the proposed changes.
    - Ran tests again to verify the solutions.

12. **Reflection and Learning:**
    - Identified new practices and heuristics that emerged from the troubleshooting process.
    - Documented these for future reference and improvement of our testing practices.

## Key Aspects That Helped Avoid False Conclusions

1. **Code Review Before Action:**
   - By reviewing the actual implementation before making changes, we avoided false assumptions based solely on test behavior.

2. **Questioning Assumptions:**
   - Regularly questioning our assumptions and conclusions helped prevent premature solutions.

3. **Mock Interaction Analysis:**
   - Analyzing how mocks interact with each other revealed complexities that weren't immediately apparent.

4. **Documentation as a Tool:**
   - Using documentation updates as part of the troubleshooting process helped clarify our understanding and reveal potential issues.

5. **Holistic View:**
   - Considering the entire system (implementation, tests, and mocks) rather than focusing solely on the failing tests.

6. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Being willing to refine our hypotheses as new information came to light.

7. **Explicit Constraint Documentation:**
   - Documenting test constraints made it easier to identify whether failures were due to incorrect test assumptions or genuine issues.

This workflow emphasizes a thoughtful, iterative approach to troubleshooting that goes beyond just fixing the immediate error. It encourages a deeper understanding of the system and helps prevent similar issues in the future.
